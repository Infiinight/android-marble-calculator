Simulating the adder circuit with marbles and physics
Not using any physics engine, I plan to build it myself (wonky, i know.)

It's not even close to done, so I'll write what the plan is for me to come back to next time.

The idea behind this project is to have a marble simulate current in a circuit, with the walls, pipes and planks acting as wires.
Using some collision logic, I plan to add working logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) and together, create a working adder circuit.

For example, a 110 would be represented by 2 marbles followed by an empty space. A 101 would be a marble, an empty space and then a marble.
Simulating numbers like this, we can introduce numbers into the circuit and (hopefully!) add numbers in binary.


Originally wanted to make a marble-calculator, but I think I'm going to leave this as it is and come back to it next time..

Currently, the collisions between marble and plank + marble and walls work.
To be done: 
Movable walls
